# By_Default_Django_Admin_Username_Change_To_Phone_Number

This change involves modifying the default username in the Django admin interface to utilize phone numbers as login credentials instead of traditional usernames. The motivation behind this modification is to enhance user convenience and security by aligning the authentication process with current trends and user preferences.

Details:

Feature Enhancement: The default Django admin username, traditionally based on email or a unique identifier, is updated to utilize phone numbers. Phone numbers are commonly used and easily remembered by users, enhancing user-friendliness and improving the login experience.

Authentication Improvement: Shifting to phone numbers for authentication aligns with modern practices and provides an additional layer of security. Phone numbers are often linked to two-factor authentication (2FA), enhancing the overall security of the application.

User Convenience: Using phone numbers as usernames simplifies the login process for users. It's a familiar and intuitive approach, reducing friction during authentication and making it easier for users to access the admin interface.

Implementation: The change involves updating the Django authentication system to accept phone numbers as usernames during login. Additionally, necessary modifications to the database schema and authentication backend will be made to support this transition.

Compatibility: The updated authentication system remains backward-compatible with existing implementations, ensuring a smooth transition for users and administrators.

Testing: Comprehensive testing will be conducted to validate the functionality and security of the new authentication system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the system functions as intended and maintains data integrity.

Documentation: The relevant documentation will be updated to reflect the change in the default admin username to phone numbers. This will include instructions for administrators on how to configure and manage this feature effectively.
